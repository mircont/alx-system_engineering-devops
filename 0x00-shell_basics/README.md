# Shell Basics Project

This project contains a collection of shell scripts designed to introduce beginners to fundamental shell scripting concepts. The scripts are tailored to perform various tasks on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, following specific guidelines such as script length, formatting, and execution permissions. From navigating directories to managing files, these scripts provide a hands-on way to learn the basics of shell scripting.
